# ElapsedTime.java
The elapsed time in my code refers to the total duration (in nanoseconds) taken to perform the computation. 
My Java code is dynamic via allowing the user to specify the sequence limit and potentially other parameters at runtime. This program ensures the code can work with different sequence limits based on user preferences, making it more reusable and interactive.
